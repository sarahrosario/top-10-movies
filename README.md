## Here's how this project works:
- I leveraged the power of the Flask web framework and the WTForms library to handle user input and dynamically render the HTML pages.
- To fetch movie data, I utilized a movie API that retrieves information about films based on user input. By selecting a movie from the list, the user can add it to their top 10 list, which is stored in a SQL database.
- To make the list easy to manage, I implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, which enables users to edit, delete or reorder their movie entries.

## This project allowed me to hone my skills with:
- Using Flask to build web applications that interact with databases
- Implementing an external API with Python requests library to retrieve movie data
- Creating and querying SQL databases for data storage and management
- Developing CRUD functionality for a smooth user experience

## Room for Improvement
- Enhancing the User Interface: I plan to create an option for other users to sign up and interact with the creator. This will enable users to share their own top 10 movie lists, view and comment on others' lists, and engage in discussions about their favorite films.

- Adding Voting Functionality: I intend to implement a voting feature that allows registered users to vote on each other's top 10 lists. This will create a more dynamic and interactive community where users can engage with each other and discover new films based on popular opinion.

- Including Multiple Lists: In addition to top 10 movie lists, I plan to introduce the option for users to create and share other types of lists, such as top 10 TV shows or top 10 books. This will add more variety and allow users to express their preferences across a wider range of media.

- Improving Website Design: Finally, I aim to enhance the website's overall layout and design to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly. This will include creating a more intuitive navigation system, improving the color scheme and typography, and ensuring that the site is fully responsive on all devices.

By implementing these improvements, I believe that this project will become an even more valuable resource for movie enthusiasts and a showcase of my skills as a developer.
